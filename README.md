As a regular League of Legends player, I decided to analyze the key factors that could help in predicting the winning team.

This analysis is done through a notebook presenting a Logistic Regression performed on a [dataset with statistics from Diamond League of Legends ranked games](https://www.kaggle.com/bobbyscience/league-of-legends-diamond-ranked-games-10-min)

All the details regarding the takeaways and conclusions are detailed in the notebook but globally, we find out that as expected, **gold** and **experience** are probably the most important factors with the dragon also having a non-negligible impact.
